# What is BoltJS Framework?
BoltJS is a simple tool for building modern web applications.  
Itâ€™s no harder to learn than jQuery and doesnâ€™t require any additional tools.

## How is it different from other frameworks?
BoltJS was created so that anyone familiar with JavaScript can build applications without the need for extra backend or frontend tooling.  
Itâ€™s small, yet powerful and complete.

* Everything you need is in a single JavaScript file (~20KB).
* No compilers or build tools are required â€” just a text editor and a browser.
* Can be seamlessly integrated into existing HTML code.
* Requires only basic JavaScript knowledge.
* Component-based architecture.
* Direct manipulation of HTML nodes.
* Extremely easy to learn and get started â€” you can write a working component in 30 seconds (!).
* SEO-friendly.
* Supports server side rendering (SSR)
